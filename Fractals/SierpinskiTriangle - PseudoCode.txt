// The Sierpinski Triangle built with random points is also called "The Sierpinski Game"
// The Sierpinski Game starts with 3 points, points of an isoscel triangle
// Each point is considered a corner

// At each step you chose a random point inside the triangle(not necessarily one of the corners)
// Then you plot a point between the random one and an existing corner
//  (if the random point coincides with the corner, between the point and another existing corner)

// At each step you will get closer to having a complete Sierpinski Triangle built with points
